*** Python bindings
    - Allow the user to configure the maximum output length by
      specifying a number by which the input length is multiplied
      using the outlenMultiplier module variable. The default will
      handle the case where every input character is undefined in the
      translation table. Previously, this was hard-coded to 2, which
      was insufficient in some cases.
    - Add compbrlLeftCursor mode constant.

*** liblouisxslt as an example
    Add liblouisxslt as an example to python/examples. This is
    basically an extension of libxslt that lets you invoke liblouis
    from an xslt stylesheet to do Braille translation on text nodes
    for example.

    Added a patch provided by Volker Bijewitz to implement
    compbrlLeftCursor.

    cells, such as in the Chinese braille tables.
*** outpos when doing back translation
    Include a patch by Timothy Lee to fix outpos when doing back translation
      (issue 11)
*** inputPos/outputPos for undefined characters
    Fix the input/output position arrays for characters in the input
      which are undefined in the translation table.
*** table fixes
    - Fixed a bug with back translation of '*n'. (issue 13)
    - Fixes to the en-us-g2.ctb table
*** Python bindings
    - Remove unnecessary imports, allowing the bindings to run in Python
      2.7. (issue 12)

      allocate enough bytes for it. Fixes possible buffer overruns and
      resultant crashes.
*** Miscellaneous
    - Fixes to the man page generation to fix issues that were
      reported by the Debian packaging builder
    - Do not invoke help2man when cross-compiling
