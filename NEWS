* Noteworthy changes in release 2.1.0 (2010-8-19)

** New features
*** New tables
    - Added tables for Portuguese grade 1 and 2
    - Added unicode.dis for Unicode braille
*** Modified tables
    - Updated Danish tables
*** Implemented language to table mapping
*** New format of error messages
    The error messages are now reported in a format similar to the one
    used in gcc. 
*** New opcode
    - added undefined opcode
*** Python bindings
    - Allow the user to configure the maximum output length by
      specifying a number by which the input length is multiplied
      using the outlenMultiplier module variable. The default will
      handle the case where every input character is undefined in the
      translation table. Previously, this was hard-coded to 2, which
      was insufficient in some cases.
    - Add compbrlLeftCursor mode constant.
    - Add compileString function which wraps lou_compileString.
    - Corrections/clarifications to docstrings.
    - Add python binding for the lou_hyphenate function.
    - Added python wrapper for lou_backTranslateString and lou_backTranslate.

*** liblouisxslt as an example
    Add liblouisxslt as an example to python/examples. This is
    basically an extension of libxslt that lets you invoke liblouis
    from an xslt stylesheet to do Braille translation on text nodes
    for example. 
*** compbrlLeftCursor
    Added a patch provided by Volker Bijewitz to implement
    compbrlLeftCursor.

** Bug fixes
*** output cursorPos
    Fix the output cursorPos when the compbrlAtCursor mode is enabled
    and the characters around the cursor translate to multiple braille
    cells, such as in the Chinese braille tables.
*** outpos when doing back translation
    Include a patch by Timothy Lee to fix outpos when doing back translation
*** table fixes
    - Fixed a bug with back translation of '*n'.
    - Fixes to the en-us-g2.ctb table
*** Python bindings
    - Fix the input/output position arrays for characters in the input
      which are undefined in the translation table.
    - Remove unnecessary imports, allowing this to run in Python 2.7
    - lou_translate* writes output information in typeform, so
      allocate enough bytes for it. Fixes possible buffer overruns and
      resultant crashes.
*** Miscellaneous
    - Fixes to the man page generation to fix issues that were
      reported by the Debian packaging builder
    - Do not invoke help2man when cross-compiling 
    - Documentation updates
    - Removing noletsign defaults
    - Many small fixes
      - Issue 10, 11, 12, 13
