These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* Requirements

If you want to build from the checked-out sources you need a the
following tools:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- makeinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>

* Installation from Subversion

If you have downloaded liblouis from subversion, e.g. with 

$ svn checkout http://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ liblouis

go to the directory it creates and bootstrap the project with the following command:

$ ./autogen.sh 

Then run configure as usual:

$ ./configure

You have the choice to compile liblouis for either 16- or 32-bit
Unicode. By default it is compiled for the former. To get 32-bit
Unicode run configure with --enable-ucs4 .

After running configure run "make" and then "make install". You must
have root privileges for the installation step.

This will produce the liblouis library and the programs lou_allround,
lou_ checktable, lou_debug and lou_translate.
