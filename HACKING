This file attempts to describe the maintainer-specific notes to follow
when hacking liblouis. 

* Release Procedure
These steps describe what a maintainer does to make a release; they
are not needed for ordinary patch submission.

** Set the version number
Update the version number in NEWS (with version, date, and release
type), ChangeLog and configure.ac.

** Commit and tag
Commit the changes and tag this version

  svn cp https://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
     https://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/tags/liblouis_1_3_8

If you know the exact version number that needs to be tagged use

  svn cp https://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
     https://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/tags/liblouis_1_3_8 -r 109

** Make the release
Check out a clean copy in a different directory, like /tmp. Run
autogen.sh and configure with no special prefixes. Run make distcheck.
This will make sure that all needed files are present, and do a
general sanity check. Run make dist. This will produce a tarball.

  ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make distcheck && make dist

** Upload
Upload tarball to Google project page, tag as "featured". This will
put the link on the main project page. Remove "featured" tag from
previous tarball release. 

** Online documentation
The online documentation is hosted out of subversion of the Google
code site. To check it out

   svn co https://liblouis.googlecode.com/svn/documentation \
     liblouis-online-documentation

then move the latest built documentation into this directory and check
it in

   cd liblouis-online-documentation
   cp ../liblouis/doc/liblouis.html .
   svn ci liblouis.html -m "Update online documentation"

** Announce
Send an announcement to the liblouis list
liblouis-liblouisxml@freelists.org. See ANNOUNCEMENT for an example.

** Other web updates
Update the Google project page. Add the current NEWS to the front
page.

Also update the page on freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net/projects/liblouis/).
