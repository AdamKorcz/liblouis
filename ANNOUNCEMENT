Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This release, which was mostly pushed out the door by Bert and Mesar,
fixes a long standing emphasis bug, adds more functionality to the
harness test suite and improves, as usual, on Braille tables. Notably
there is a brand new finish table backed by Celia.
