2.6.4 The release is available for download at:

    https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This is a minor release in terms of features. But in terms of test
coverage and stability it is a vast improvement over previous versions
of Liblouis. The new YAML based test suite contains more than a
million of validated translations. Every change in Liblouis is tested
against this corpus ensuring the change doesn't break anything.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- YAML based harness tests. Harness tests can now be written in simple
  YAML notation and they are integrated with the normal `make check`
  command. They can be used for both ucs2 and ucs4 and no Python is
  required. Thanks to Christian Egli.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Use a separate gnulib instance for the library and the tools. Use
  the strndup module to avoid build problems on windows.
- Fix a problem with the nocross opcode when used in combination with
  the opcodes nocont and compbrl, thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Fix a problem with the decoding of the harness test files. Thanks to
  Bert Frees.
- Fix numerous problems in the way braille indicators are handled.
  There is now a safe version of the checkAttr function which makes
  sure that no attributes are checked beyond the boundaries of the
  currentInput. This fixes the random behavior with tests where the
  emphasis extends to the end of the input string. Thanks to Christian
  Egli.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- if found use texi2any to build the documentation, thanks to Martin
  Michlmayr.
- Fix permissions of Korean tables, thanks to Peter Lundblad.
- Update the windows build instructions, thanks to Bue
  Vester-Andersen.

Braille table improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improvements to Hungarian, thanks to Attila Hammer
- Improvements to Hungarian 8 dot and Serbian grade 1, thanks to
  Zvonimir Stanecic

Next release
============

The next release will be published on November 30 2015 so please keep up
the excellent work and keep those improvements coming.

Share and Enjoy!
