Introduction
------------	

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisutdml/liblouisxml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
-----------------------

  This release contains nine months worth of braille table improvements
  for example for UEB, en-us, Nemeth, Bulgarian, Slovenian and many
  more. Also there are fixes to the core for table path resolving and
  back-translation.


New features

  - Added function lou_registerTableResolver for plugging in a table
    resolver callback from your host language.


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  - Fixed ENDSEGMENT indicator in computer Braille thanks to John Boyer.
  - Emphasized words should now be contracted consistently thanks to
    John Boyer.
  - Fixed several problems with back-translation. A slash within a
    number and strings such as 5-inch-diameter and 25-year-old-man
    should now back-translate correctly. Thanks to John Boyer.
  - Fixed a problem with syllable opcode. Thanks to John Boyer.
  - Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2. Thanks to Peter Lundblad.
  - When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path, the
    "includes" in that table will now work as expected, meaning files in
    the same directory will be found.
