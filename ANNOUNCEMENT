Introduction
------------	

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille[1], supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[2].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisxml[3] deals with formatting of braille. 

Changes in this release
