[[!meta title="Liblouis*"]]

intro: The Liblouis software suite provides an open-source braille translator, back-translator and formatter for a large number of languages and braille codes. It is a set of libraries designed for use in any of a number of applications, both free and commercial. It is written in C so that it does not require a runtime environment and hence can be used in applications written in high-level languages such as Java and Python.

## Braille translator and back-translator

**Liblouis** is an open-source braille translator and back-translator named in honor of [Louis Braille][louis]. It features support for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and uncontracted translation for [many languages][tablesInMaster] and has support for hyphenation. New languages can easily be added through tables that support a rule- or dictionary based approach. Tools for testing and debugging tables are also included. Liblouis also supports math braille (Nemeth and Marburg).

Liblouis has features to support screen-reading programs. This has led to its use in two open-source screenreaders, [NVDA][] and [Orca][]. It is also used in some commercial assistive technology applications for example by [ViewPlus][].

Liblouis is based on the translation routines in the [BRLTTY][] screenreader for Linux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines. In Linux and Mac OSX it is a shared library, and in Windows it is a DLL.

Liblouis is free software licensed under the [GNU Lesser GPL][gpl].

## Braille formatter

**Liblouisutdml** is an open-source braille formatter. The formatting can be configured via a style sheet. By incorporating Liblouis it provides the capability of translating any XML or plain text file into properly transcribed, embosser-ready braille. This includes translation into grade two, mathematical codes, etc.

Liblouisutdml is free software licensed under the [GNU Lesser GPL][gpl].

## Braille production

There are two braille production systems based on Liblouis and Liblouisutdml.

[BrailleBlaster][], a joint project between ViewPlus Technologies, American Printing House for the Blind and Abilitiessoft, is aimed at hands-on production where every detail of the Braille is controlled via a graphical user interface.

[DAISY Pipeline][dpipe], backed by the DAISY Consortium, is aimed at automated, hands-off, high-volume production on the server.
