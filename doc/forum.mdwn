If you need help or advice, please ensure it is not covered below,
then search [the mailing list archive][ll_mlist_archive] or [post to the list][ll_mlist].
If you have worked out something that has not been documented and might be useful to others please post it here.

But, please don't post bug reports here. Put them in [[bugs]].  
And please don't make wishlist requests here. Put them in [[todo]].  
(If you post bugs/todo here, it'll just get moved.)
