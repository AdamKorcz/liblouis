I have the following lines in my g2 table:

letsign 6
...
context _$l[]$D @6

The goal is to get a letsign (dot 6) between any letter and the numsign. Otherwise, the numsign will be interpreted as a "ve" contraction.
However, if I place an underline before $l, Liblouis loops until it reaches 512 letsign/numsign combinations and then breaks out. I suspect it is because the brackets are empty to signify the boarder between letter and digit. with something in the brackets, it seems to work ok.
If I make the same line without the "_", it does work sometimes. However, the previous opcode may "steal" the last letter before the digits, so that the context opcode never sees it.

Can anyone confirm this behaviour?
Can anyone think of a good work-around for this problem?
