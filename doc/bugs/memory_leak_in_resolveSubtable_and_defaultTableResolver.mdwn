I ran valgrind on the svn version of liblouis and lo and behold it
reported some memory leaks (in Berts new table resolver code of all
places). The analysis is straight forward once you see the problem: we
have a strdup in a loop and overwrite the existing reference to it

for (subTable = strdup (tableList); ; subTable = cp + 1)

I guess there needs to be a call to free after the sprintf. [[bert.frees]] can
you do this?
