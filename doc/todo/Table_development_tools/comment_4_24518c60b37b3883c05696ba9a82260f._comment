A new idea is to split the hyphen table in a hyphenation part and a translation part in
order to use the same table for both purposes. Patterns of level 1 to x would be active
for hyphenation and translation, while patterns of level x+1 to 9 would be active for
translation only. The value of x would be configurable with a new liblouis rule. The
hyphenation part would, just like the translation part, be generated automatically, but
based on an enhanced dictionary with correctly hyphenated words.

The goal should be to have no contractions cancelling hyphenation points. One way to
assure this could be to not allow any patterns of an even level in the translation part
(TODO: verify this statement!).
