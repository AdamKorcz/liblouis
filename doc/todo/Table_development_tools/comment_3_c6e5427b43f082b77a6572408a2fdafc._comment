Make the following considerations when choosing contractions rules.

- Obviously, contractions need to match the braille system as well as possible, but
  that's not always easy to verify if you don't know the language/system.
- It's best to keep contractions as short as possible because in general shorter
  means fewer.
- Don't make them too short because in general shorter also means
  - they need to be inhibited more often (i.e. there will be more hyphen patterns), and
  - chances are higher that the maximum of two different contractions per string is
    exceeded (remember it's two because we're using two opcodes: nocross and syllable*)
- Few and short contractions is more important than few hyphen patterns because
  contractions need to be readable and understandable whereas patterns are generated
  and don't need to be looked at.
- Ideally hyphen patterns should match the hyphenation rules as well as possible
  because the original idea was to use a single hyphen table file for both translation
  and hyphenation (see below for a new idea to loosen this constraint).
- When one string has two separate contractions, it might make more sense to assign the
  nocross rule to a particular contraction and the syllable* rule to the other.

To conclude, the best strategy is to be conservative in making contractions:

- Don't make contractions too short initially, then can always be split up later.
- Before adding a contraction check in the dictionary how common it is and only add it
  when it's evident.
