We have letters that are so rarely used that the dot patterns are being used as partword contractions. In grade 2, they always need a letsign when they appear as letters and not as contractions. In Danish we have q, w, x and z plus a whole lot of accented letters that are mainly used with words in other languages. I think there is a similar issue with y in German grade 2 (please, correct me if I am wrong). There must also be other examples from other languages.

Currently, I apply "always" opcodes to all these letters, but it is messy and very sensitive to the order of rules in the table.
