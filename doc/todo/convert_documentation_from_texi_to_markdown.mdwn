[[!tag documentation]] 

Simplify documentation by converting it out of texi into markdown.
This will give us:

*   Uniform markup, issues, news, website content, documentation, all using one markup language.
*   Documentation is instantly updated on the website, we don't have to build/push html version.
*   We don't have to be afraid of breaking texi.
*   We can still get man pages using mdwn2man.
