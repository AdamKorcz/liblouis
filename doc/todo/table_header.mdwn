We need to finally develop a header format that can contain metadata
about the table, and an API that can extract this metadata and query
tables. The most common need is to have pretty table names in GUI's.

There have been numerous discussions about this in the past, and
[[greg.kearney]] has brought it up again lately:

- [Translatable table names in Liblouis...](http://www.freelists.org/post/liblouis-liblouisxml/Translatable-table-names-in-Liblouis-independent-with-screen-readers-now-used-methods-possible-doing-this) (22 May 2012)
- [Grouping tables according to language and Braille code](http://www.freelists.org/post/liblouis-liblouisxml/Grouping-tables-according-to-language-and-Braille-code) (23 July 2012)
- [List of Braille tables (standalone)](http://www.freelists.org/post/liblouis-liblouisxml/List-of-Braille-tables-standalone,15) (21 March 2013)
- [Table of human readable tables](http://www.freelists.org/post/liblouis-liblouisxml/Table-of-human-readable-tables) (3 June 2014)

(add more links if you find them!)

I don't think that the once suggested alternative of encoding the
metadata in file names is an option anymore, the main support comes
for the table header idea.

Greg's proposal is not bad:

    #afr#1#Afrikaans Uncontracted#za#Afrikaans ongekontrakteerde

but for me this format is not flexible/extensible enough. I'd like to
see for example some kind of list of key-value pairs where some
keys/values are standardized and other can be freely chosen.
