[[!tag code refactor]] 

At the moment we have memory allocation checks, code that looks like:


    ChainEntry *newEntry = malloc (entrySize);
    if (!newEntry)
        outOfMemory ();
In an [email][1] [[christian.egli]] refers to gnulib xmalloc, our code would become:

    ChainEntry *newEntry = xmalloc (entrySize);

This seems reasonable, and something we should be doing.
No point reinventing code.

Christian, in the email you refered to license, but this should not be a problem, since we already use gnulib.
