configure.ac does not check for nose at the moment.
Instead it is done with a try except in the python script. Need to be
added to configure.ac so that debian packages can automatically pick
up dependencies.

    sudo apt-get build-dep liblouis2

Doesn't show python-nose or python3-nose, which means that if someone wants to build and check the harness tests they wil be skipped.

[[christian.egli]], might you be able to do this?
