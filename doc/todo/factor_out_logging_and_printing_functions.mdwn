[[!tag code refactor]] 

We have duplicated functionality for printing various strings/widestrings for logging purposes.
Refering to the code that Michael recently introduced, and the code that we have in brl_check.c
There might be other places where we have duplicated printing functionality.

Todo:

*   Identify what types of strings we should be printing.
*   Factor our functions out into a new file, where all logging/printing should live, function signatures should probably stay where they are.
