At the moment we have 3 versions of a so called UEB table, none of which is complete/correct.

1.  The old  UEBC-g1.utb UEBC-g2.ctb
2.  Accidentally committed into master but incomplete  en-ueb-chardefs.uti en-ueb-g1.ctb en-ueb-g2.ctb
3.  tables/ueb branch, en-ueb-chardefs.uti en-ueb-g1.ctb en-ueb-g2.ctb.
    Work between Mesar, Joseph and Ken to follow the rulebook section by section, in the hope to produce a UEB table from scratch without influence of any US table.

The version in the test/ueb branch is most likely of the higher quality, but it is not complete.
We need to have extensive UEB tests to ensure we get the best of each
version/that each correctly translated case is matched by the version in branch
tables/ueb.
People will assume that we have good UEB tables, but they do not know which tables to use, so this deduplication and removal of non-complete tables should be done sooner rather than later.

The tests should cover both forward and back translations.

Tests can already be written, but would be made simpler once the dependancy is resolved.
