When liblouis was hosted on google project using svn[1], [[mesar.hameed]] set up an unofficial git mirror on bitbucket[2].
This was done for the following reasons:

1. Be able to use liblouis as a git submodule to nvda, to make it easier to create a table and build a try-snapshot to get feedback for a particular table change.
2. As a staging/work in progress area until tables/code matured.

Now that the liblouis code has been migrated to git:

*  **done** Get confermation from Jamie that all NVDA branches/tags refer to the new repo.
*  **done** The commits on the topic branches of [2] need to be carefully picked onto the matching commits on the rewritten repo.

Branches:

*   dev-hu -> hammera_hu
    Everything has a test, ready to merge before next release.
*   dev-ko -> jlee-ko-exp
    Just experimental, rewrote so that it is based on the rewritten repo, but left it on bitbucket in case joseph.lee still needs the experiments.
*   dev-da **deleted**, already merged into master.
*   dev-ueb -> tables/ueb
    Unfortunately it seems that Joseph submitted some of the tables before the work was completed, and [[christian.egli]] committed it to the repo.


        commit 53da5b90235fda375fa837aac78a168992e24701
        Author: Christian Egli <christian.egli@alumni.ethz.ch>
        Date:   Mon Dec 3 15:49:00 2012 +0000
        Added ueb tables that were sent by Joseph Lee


    While work continued on the files in the bitbucket repo, by following the rulebook,
    the one in svn also received different updates, producing yet another version.

Created new todo item:

[[todo/deduplicate_ueb_tables]]

[[todo/done]]
