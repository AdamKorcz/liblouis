- [ ] come up with some well-defined method for developing tables,
- [ ] write supporting tools for it
- [ ] and document

The idea is not to make a super-low threshold tool for computer illiterates, developing tables with this method will still require knowledge of the table format. But it will automate things as much as possible, and it will be a guidance for people that don't have a clue about where to begin.

As things look at the moment, the method will be largely based on the approach that Bue uses for his Danish tables.

More info will follow.
