[[!tag code]]

Both compBrlLeftCursor and compBrlAtCursor have the right intension,
but does not match cursor behaviour expected by the user.

compBrlLeftCursor was added to account for the floors in compBrlAtCursor, but
because it did not have tests and the specification was not defined before the
implementation, it still did not solve the original problem.

What needs to be done:

-   Give examples of how both flags produce wrong output.
-   Write specification for correct behaviour.
-   Check with [[james.teh]]
-   Fix the code and remove  compBrlLeftCursor.
