Note: this is just a snapshot of my ideas regarding all of these
subjects. We need to split this into several pages and/or merge with
other pages later.

## Contributing rules

These are the terms for contributions in order to be accepted (as of September 1st).

Some things are always required:

- A NEWS entry (at least one per modified table per release).

Some things are required only in some cases

- A reference to an official braille specification. Ideally this
  document should be commited to the `formal-braille-spec` repository.
- Test data. Ideally with comments and references. A minimal set of
  tests is proposed in [[posts/minimum_set_of_tests_for_a_table]].

Some things are recommended but optional:

- Comments throughout the table explaining individual rules. Ideally
  with references in them.

We can distinguish different cases:

- If a contribution only adds new files
  - then it can be accepted without test data but then references to
    official documents are required.
  - However, for becoming the default table for a certain
    language/grade instead of another table, the same rules apply as
    for in the case the table would replace the other (see below).
- If a contribution modifies or deletes files
  - and if those files are from the same author
    - then it can be accepted witout test data or references.
  - If those files are from another author
    - then table changes can only be accepted if test data are
      provided that explain the changes (ideally with references), and
      no existing tests break. (TODO: what if a table change breaks a
      test for another table that includes the modified table?)
    - Modified or deleted tests can only be accepted if the
      original author agrees. The commit message should have a notice
      of whether the original author could be contacted or not. (TODO:
      what if the original author doesn't agree?)

## Author's guide

TBD. A couple of requests/suggestions were made on the mailing list:

> It would also be nice if someone created a short documentation with
> steps of what maintainers want for changes like table changes. Also
> what maintainers want for changes in the c code.  For example a
> small document showing a table change,, what words it was for,
> example test cases added to the automated tests for the change, and
> anything else you guys are expecting like the news change. This
> should be laid out in a step by step example form so that we can
> just follow it and make your job easier in that you would just have
> to read through the commit log and if all steps were followed accept
> it.

> Adding to this, it would be nice if some training documentation
> could be put together to teach newcomers how to develop tables. I
> know there is documentation on the subject, but it is reference
> material and difficult for a newcomer to use. [...]
