Liblouis tests
==============

This is an example test file in reStructuredText format. First import
the ``louis`` module:

    >>> import louis

Then define the table you want to test

    >>> tables = ['en-GB-g2.ctb']

Now do some tests.

Check that "the" is correctly contracted
    >>> louis.translateString(tables, 'the cat sat on the mat')
    u'! cat sat on ! mat'

Make sure that "to" is contracted correctly and joined to next word.
    >>> louis.translateString(tables, 'to the moon')
    u'6! moon'

Check that "to" at end of line doesn't get contracted, and that "went"
is expanded when cursor is positioned within the word. ``translate``
returns a tuple where the first element contains the contracted
braille and the fourth element contains the position of the cursor in
the output
    >>> louis.translate(tables, 'you went to', cursorPos=4, mode=louis.compbrlAtCursor)[0]
    u'y went to'
    >>> louis.translate(tables, 'you went to', cursorPos=4, mode=louis.compbrlAtCursor)[3]
    2
