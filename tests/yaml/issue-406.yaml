# backtranslation for "ó" (lowercase o acute) doesn't seem to work

table: [tables/unicode.dis, tables/Es-Es-G0.utb]
flags: {testmode: forward}
tests:
  # forward translation works
  - [ó, ⠬]

table: [tables/unicode.dis, tables/Es-Es-G0.utb]
flags: {testmode: backward}
tests:
  # backward translation seems to fail
  - [⠬, ó, {xfail: true}]
  # this test seems weird: Why should 34678 be translated as ó? The
  # Es-Es-G0.utb table defines 0 to be 34678 (`digit 0 34678`)
  - [⣬, ó, {xfail: Not sure if this test is even valid}]
