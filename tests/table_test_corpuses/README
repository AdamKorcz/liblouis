Files that are placed within this directory and that start with
"test_" followed with a proper table name will be used to do corpus
based table tests. For example the file "test_en-us-g2.ctb" will be
used to test the table en-us-g2.ctb.

Each file is expected to contain two columns (separated by white
space). The first one contains a word and the second one contains the
expected Braille translation. So, every line forms a pair of words,
first the input and second the expected translation. Empty lines and
lines starting with a '#' are ignored. So for example the following
line

world	      _w

would send the word "world" to lou_translate and would check if "_w"
is returned by it. 

This allows you to define a corpus of tests (input and expected
output) against your table and will give you more reassurance when
changing the tables.
