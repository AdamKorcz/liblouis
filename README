DOCUMENTATION

For documentation, see liblouis-guide.html and liblouis-guide.txt in the
doc directory. For examples of translation tables, see en-us-g2.ctb
en-us-g1.ctb chardefs.cti, and whatever other files they may include in
the tables directory.  This directory contains tables for many
languages. The Nemeth files will only work with the sister library
liblouisxml.

INSTALLATION

After unpacking the distribution tarball go to the directory it creates. 
You now have the choice to compile liblouis for either 16- or 32-bit
unicode. By default it is compiled for the former. To get 32-bit Unicode
run configure with --enable-ucs4 .

After running configure run "make" and then "make install". You must
have root privileges for the installation step.

This will produce the liblouis library and the programs lou_allround,
lou_checktable and lou_translate. 

RELEASE NOTES 

The program lou_allround is for testing the library. It is completely
interactive. lou_checktable is for checking translation tables for
errors. lou_translate is for extensive testing of the translation and
back-translation capabilities. For more details see liblouis-guide.html.
