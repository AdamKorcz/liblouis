DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is in the docs directory and consists principally of
liblouis-guide.html and liblouis-guide.txt . All known tables are in the
tablq subdirectory. For examples of translation tables, see en-us-g2.ctb
en-us-g1.ctb chardefs.cti and whatever other files they may include. 
The Nemeth files will only work with the sister library liblouisxml.

INSTALLATION

After unpacking the distribution tarball go to the directory it creates. 
You now have the choice to compile liblouis for either 16- or 32-bit 
unicode. By default it is compiled for the former. To get 32-bit 
Unicode 
edit the file liblouis.h and on the line which defines widechar remove 
the word "short".

liblouis comes with Makefiles for Linux and Mac OS X, so type either
make -f linux-Makefile
or
make -f macosx-Makefile

This will produce the library liblouis.so.1 (or .dylib) and the programs
allround, checktable and translate. Get root privileges and go to
whereever your Unix flavor likes to keep libraries. On Redhat systems it
is /usr/lib . In this directory type a command like:

ln -s /home/myname/unpackeddir/liblouis.so.1 liblouis.so

RELEASE NOTES 

The program allround tests all features of the library. It is completely
interactive. checktable is for checking translation tables for errors.
The command line is checktable tablename. translate will translate a
file. Type translate -h for usage information.
