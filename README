DOCUMENTATION

For documentation, see liblouis-guide.html and liblouis-guide.txt . For
examples of translation tabres, see en-us-g2.ctb en-us-g1.ctb
chardefs.cti text.nabcc.dis and whatever other files they may include.

Note that there are two Makefiles in this distribution. linux-Makefile 
is for compilation on Linux systems. macosx-Makefile is for compilation 
on Mac OS X systems. You will have to copy the file for whichever system 
you are using to Makefile. The Makefile in the distribution is for Mac 
OS X, since that is where I am currently doing development work. 
Previously a Redhat FC3 Linux system was used.

INSTALLATION

After unpacking the distribution tarball go to the directory it creates
and type "make". This will produce the library liblouis.so.1 (or .dylib)
and the programs roundtrip, testback, checktable and translate.  Get
root privileges and go to whereever your Unix flavor likes to keep
libraries. On Redhat systems it is /usr/lib . In this directory type a
command like:

ln -s /home/myname/unpackeddir/liblouis.so.1 liblouis.so

RELEASE NOTES 

The program roundtrip is for testing translation followed by
back-translation. It is interactive and has no arguments. testback is
for testing back-translation only. It is also interactive.  checktable
is for checking translation tables for errors. The command line is
checktable tablename. translate will translate a file. Type translate -h
for usage information.

The standard GNU "configure, make, make install" procedure will be added 
when the pressure of development becomes somewhat less.
