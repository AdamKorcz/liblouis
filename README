DOCUMENTATION

For documentation, see liblouis-guide.html and liblouis-guide.txt . For
examples of translation tables, see en-us-g2.ctb en-us-g1.ctb
chardefs.cti text.nabcc.dis and whatever other files they may include. 
These tables are in the main directory you will obtain after unpacking 
the tarball. The files in the moreTables subdirectory are for other 
languages and braille codes. They have not been tested as extensively. 
The Nemeth files will only work with the sister library liblouisxml.

INSTALLATION

After unpacking the distribution tarball go to the directory it creates. 
You now have the choice to compile liblouis for either 16- or 32-bit 
unicode. By default it is compiled for the former. To get 32-bit 
Unicode 
edit the file liblouis.h and on the line which defines widechar remove 
the word "short".

liblouis comes with Makefiles for Linux and Mac OS X, so type either
make -f linux-Makefile
or
make -f macosx-Makefile

This will produce the library liblouis.so.1 (or .dylib)
and the programs roundtrip, basicround, dotsround, testback, checktable 
and translate. Get
root privileges and go to whereever your Unix flavor likes to keep
libraries. On Redhat systems it is /usr/lib . In this directory type a
command like:

ln -s /home/myname/unpackeddir/liblouis.so.1 liblouis.so

RELEASE NOTES 

The program roundtrip is for testing translation followed by
back-translation. It is interactive and has no arguments. testback is
for testing back-translation only. It is also interactive. checktable
is for checking translation tables for errors. The command line is
checktable tablename. translate will translate a file. Type translate -h
for usage information.

The standard GNU "configure, make, make install" procedure will be added 
when the pressure of development becomes somewhat less.
